# Chinook

Chinook is a  protocol for exchanging simple, 4-field JSON messages over websockets,
passing back and forth between Javascript in the browser, and computational servers 
(typically written in R and Python).  Chinook thus facilitates
the construction of loosely-coupled, highly interactive webapps.

Our main focus is the Oncoscpe web application, which is focused on computational biology, 
bioinformatics, and solid tumor translational research [(see STTR)](http://www.sttrcancer.org).  
The methods presented here, however, can easily be applied in other fields.
