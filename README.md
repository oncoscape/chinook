# chinook

A protocol for exchanging simple 4-field JSON messages over websockets,
between Javascript in the browser, and computational servers (in R and Python), 
to build loosely-coupled, highly interactive webapps.

Our protocol gets its name from the [Chinook
Jargon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_Jargon), a very simple
trading language - a pidgin or contact language - used in the Pacific
Northwest for many centuries. The last Chinook speakers lived in
Seattle, passed away in the 1930's.  With a vocabulary of about 400
words and a very simple grammar, it allowed speakers of many
Amerindian languages to communicate enough to conduct extensive trade.
A few French and English words were added in the nineteenth century.

Chinook is a model and inspiration for us because we have a similar
need: like Chinook speakers, we need to connect rich and complex
entities as simply as possible.  Economies were connected in the
historical case.  In our case, we wish to connect problem domains
(genomic analysis, network biology, clinical histories), and
computational biology and visualization tools into user-friendly
exploratory webapps.  Chinook speakers developed a broad and
extensive collaborative economy using only a small number of shared
words. Similarly, we seek to create an extensive computational
environment based upon the exchange of simple messages between powerful
computational services and visualization tools.
