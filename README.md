# chinook
Exchange simple 4-field JSON messages over websockets: a protocol for building loosely-coupled webapps.

Our protocol gets its name from the "Chinook Jargon", a very simple trading language - a pidgin, a contact language - used in the Pacific Northwest for many centuries. The last Chinook speakers lived in Seattle, passed away in the 1930's.  With a vocabulary of about 400 words and a very simple grammar, it allowed speakers of many Amerindian languages to communicate enough to conduct extensive trade.  A few French and English words were added in the nineteenth century.  

Chinook is a model and inspiration for us because we have a similar need:   like Chinook speakers, we need to connect rich and complex entities as simply as possible.  Economies were connected in the historical case.  In our case, we wish to connect  problem domains (genomic analysis, network biology, clinical histories), and computational biology and visualization tools into user-friendly exploratory webapps..  Chinook speakers developed a broad and extensive collaborative economy using only a small number of shared words. Similarly, we are creating an extensive computational environment based upon the exchange simple messages between powerful computational services and visualization tools.
